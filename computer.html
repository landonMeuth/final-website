		<h1>Computers</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my computer page! You can see pictures of old computers, learn interesting facts about them, and even use virtual ones. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
		
		<h3>Analytical Engine</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/1.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>Proposed in 1837 by Charles Babbage, but never actually built, the Analytical Engine is probably the first concept of a general purpose computer. It would have been fully mechanical, with a steam engine turning its gears. It had "stores" that were piles of gears made to contain numbers, an arithmetical unit, and a punch card reader to interpret instructions.</p>

		<h3>The Altair 8800</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/2.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>Released in 1774, this is one of the first personal computers! In only had 8 switches and lights for addressing, monitering, and altering the internal RAM, which there was only 256 bytes of. It was a limited machine, but it marked the start of the micro-computer revolution!</p>

		<h3>Apple 1</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/3.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>Designed and made by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1976. The Apple 1 could display text to a screen, which was revolutionary for a home computer, though you still had to program it byte by byte like an Altair. A weird quirk of the machine was that there was no video memory, but instead an oversized shift register. Video ran independently from the computer, and you could only write to the screen not delete anything. It was offered at a price of $666.66.</p>

		<h3>Apple ][</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/4.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>Apple’s second computer, released in 1977, was a massive upgrade. It had more memory, it had color graphics, it could be mass produced, it had the BASIC language built in! It was a huge success. The color graphics were strange though, the graphics were really monochrome, but pixel combinations resulted in different colors on a color monitor, meaning color and monochrome could be interchangeable and less memory would be needed to drive the video. This was important because businesses needed the text to be clear and monochrome monitors were better at that sort of thing.</p>

		<h3>TRS-80</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/5.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>Tandy Corporation, in tandem with Radio Shack, released the Tandy Radio Shack 80, or TRS-80 in 1977. It was monochrome only and not as impressive as its competitors, but it was way cheaper than them too. Being available in Radio Shack stores made it a popular choice for consumers at the time.</p>

		<h3>Pet</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/6.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>Commodore, a company that had previously made electronic calculators, made the Pet in 1977. It was cheaper than the Apple 2, yet more expensive than the TRS-80. The computer had no color and no sprites either. The machine had a built-in cassette drive. Cassettes could store binary as sound and it was cheaper for the consumer to buy than a floppy drive. It sold well in the US education market.</p>

		<h3>Vic-20</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/7.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>The Vic-20, released in 1980, was Commodore's second computer. Its goal was to be affordable and relatively easy to use. It was marketed as both a computer and a gaming system like an atari to attract the family market. It had no sprites like the Pet, but the text characters could be reprogrammed to take the shape of pictures and the video was in full real color. Games were often distributed as cartridges to be plugged into the back of the unit.</p>

		<h3>IBM-PC</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/8.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>In 1981, IBM released the IBM-PC. It didn’t run BASIC. Instead it had the Microsoft Disk Operating System or MS-DOS. You could actually save files, and put them into directories like you could with the big scary mainframe computers meaning it was a popular option for businesses along with home users. Since it was made with all off the shelf parts, once competitors figured out how to make a compatible BIOS, they could release compatible machines which made the PC a standard for computers.</p>

		<h3>Macintosh</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/9.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>Apple released the Macintosh in 1984. It was revolutionary for its Graphical User Interface, though it wasn't the first widely available computer to have one. Xerox had a prototype for one that never came out, and Steve Jobs saw it and used the Idea for the Apple Lisa. The Macintosh released after the Lisa and was more successful than it. You could use a mouse to draw, select options, click buttons, navigate files and more!</p>

		<h3>Windows 1.0</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/10.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>Although this was just software, Windows 1.0 was released in 1985 as a competitor to the Macintosh’s OS. Windows didn’t overlap or move freely, instead they were tiled. Alot of software wasn’t compatible with windows, so multitasking wasn’t always possible and it ran slow. It was not successful, but it paved the way for later versions that would become standard across all computers.</p>

		<h3>Amiga 500</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/11.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>The Amiga 500, released in 1985 by Commodore, was a groundbreaking computer from commodore. It had great graphics and sound compared to their competitors, and it was even cheaper than a few of them. It also had a GUI called the Amiga Workbench, which could run multiple programs at once. Multitasking was a big deal for computers. Since it had great graphics, it was most often used for playing video games.</p>

		<h3>Windows 95</h3>
		<img src="./COMPIC/12.jpg" height="200px">
		<p>Windows 95 released in 1995. It was a huge success! With multimedia capabilities, the introduction of the start button, and the internet becoming available, it made owning a computer more common and understandable to the masses.</p>
